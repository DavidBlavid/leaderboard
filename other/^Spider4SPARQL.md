# Spider4SPARQL

**Spider4SPARQL**<sup>[[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup>  is a new SPARQL benchmark dataset featuring 9,693 manually generated NL questions and 4,721 unique, novel, and complex SPARQL queries of varying complexity (There can be mutilple natural language questions per SPARQL query). In addition to the NL/SPARQL pairs, we also provide the corresponding 166 knowledge graphs and ontologies, which cover 138 different domains. This complex benchmark enables novel ways of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of modern KGQA systems.  [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16248.pdf).

The total dataset consists of 166 novel knowledge graphs, with 9,693 natural language/SPARQL pairs that have been split into 1034/8695 pairs for dev/ train respectively. The model performance was evaluated using execution accuracy.
